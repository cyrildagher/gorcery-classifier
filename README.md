# 🧠 Grocery Store Classifier

## Overview

**Grocery Store Classifier** is a competitive intelligence tool designed for small-to-mid-sized grocery stores. It analyzes raw data from competitor stores and classifies them into strategic categories like **Organic**, **Discount**, or **Bulk**. This helps businesses make data-informed decisions on pricing and inventory.

## 🚩 Problem

Small grocery businesses often struggle with understanding their competition due to:
- **Pricing blindspots** — leading to lost customers or profit margins
- **Inventory mismatches** — stocking the wrong products for their target market

Manual methods like store visits or spreadsheets are time-consuming and ineffective.

## ✅ Solution

An automated tool that:
- **Inputs**: Product types, pricing info, and store size
- **Processes**: Applies logic or ML to classify store types
- **Outputs**:
  - Strategic store labels (e.g., `Organic`, `Discount`)
  - Optional HTML/CSV report for easy viewing

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `csv`, (optionally `scikit-learn`)
- **Output Formats**: HTML, CSV
- **Optional**: Flask or Streamlit for UI

---

## 💡 Example Use Case

> "FreshMart is classified as **Organic** → Price local produce 10% lower than theirs."
